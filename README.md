# Thomann Blowout Notifier

This project is a handy tool for music enthusiasts and bargain hunters who are interested in synthesizer deals from Thomann, a popular music equipment retailer.

## What it does

1. **Fetches Deals**: The application automatically checks Thomann's website for synthesizer products that are on blowout sale.

2. **Filters Results**: It filters the products to focus on the best deals, excluding items that are too expensive or don't meet certain criteria.

3. **Organizes Information**: The tool organizes the product information, including details like price, availability, and whether it's a B-stock item.

4. **Prioritizes Behringer Products**: It gives special attention to Behringer products, listing them at the top of the results.

5. **Creates an Email**: The application compiles all this information into a neatly formatted HTML email.

6. **Sends Notification**: Finally, it sends this email to a specified address, keeping you updated on the latest synthesizer deals without having to constantly check the website yourself.
